Weather Application Overview

This weather application is built using Node.js as the runtime environment, providing a robust backend for handling requests. The Express.js framework simplifies routing and middleware management, allowing for efficient API interactions. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) serves as the template engine, enabling dynamic rendering of HTML pages based on user input and API responses.

For fetching weather data, Axios is utilized to make HTTP requests to a weather API, ensuring seamless data retrieval. Users can input their location to receive real-time weather updates, which are then displayed in a user-friendly interface.
